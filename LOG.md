## Completed:
1. Added .env
2. 

## Pending:
1. Build out first API Request
    1. API Req will get static list of players recent games
    <!-- It feels like this should be done with a server and not a front end... Like the FE should send a simple req for player data, and then a backend service should parse all of the request components -->
